        <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the 

            inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow 
            
            at the University of Oxford and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Berners-Lee proposed 

            an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext

             Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web 

             browser and Web server, and helped foster the Web's subsequent explosive development. He is the founder and director of

              the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary

              Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of 

              Sciences.</p>
